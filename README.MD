## Tech Used
This site use to use React, then used the TypeScript version of React, and now it finally doesn't have any of that. This decision was because the site did not have enough on it to warrant maintaining the build process of a React app. Instead, I chopped it down to simple HTML, CSS, and JS with my own very small build process.
